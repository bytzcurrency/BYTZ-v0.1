What is BYTZ?
--------------

BYTZ is a blockchain-based entertainment utility protocol powered by a
cryptographically secure multilayered network. Decentralized delivery yields
low-cost, high-speed, high-definition media access globally. Consumers will be
able to spend BYTZ cryptocurrency (BYTZ) on some of the best entertainment the
world has to offer. Tickets will be forgery resistant, virtually eliminating
fraud. Service providers holding BYTZ can earn even more by storing and
delivering content.

Together with this use case BYTZ also features fast and private transactions
with low transaction fees and a low environmental footprint.  It utilizes a
custom Proof of Stake protocol for securing its network and uses an innovative
variable seesaw reward mechanism that dynamically balances 90% of its block
reward size between masternodes and staking nodes and 10% dedicated for budget
proposals.
